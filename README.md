# YouTube No Playlist!

This extension for firefox allows you to open YouTube videos from a playlist
in a new tab as standalone videos without the (autoplaying) playlist.

## Build

The add-on can be built using `web-ext`:

```sh
web-ext build
```

This creates an unsigned add-on. To build a signed version, you have to change
the add-on id and submit the add-on to [Mozilla Add-ons][amo] for signing.
